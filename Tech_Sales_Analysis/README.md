# Tech & Gadget Sales Analysis (2019)

This project explores the 2019 sales performance of a tech and gadget retail company using over 185,000 customer orders from 8 U.S. states. I used Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for modeling and dashboarding.

The objective was to translate raw sales data into meaningful insights about customer behavior, product performance, geographic trends, and revenue concentration—with the goal of offering practical, data-driven strategies that could improve revenue growth and business planning.

## Dataset Summary

| Metric                | Value             |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| Total Revenue         | $32.03 million   |
| Products Sold         | 208,771 units    |
| Total Orders          | 185,652          |
| Unique Customers      | 140,787          |

| States Covered        | 8                |
| Customer Segments     | Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze |

Data preparation in Excel included resolving missing entries, removing duplicates, standardizing customer labels, and validating key columns. Once cleaned, the dataset was modeled in Power BI to build interactive dashboards using DAX and slicers for deeper exploration.

### Insight 1: Q4 and Q2 Contribute Nearly Half of All Annual Revenue

**What the data shows:**

- December led all months with $4.29M in revenue, followed by October at $3.48M  
- Q4 (Oct–Dec) alone accounts for over 33% of annual revenue  
- Q2 (Apr–Jun) adds another 14%, bringing the combined share to 47%  
- January recorded the lowest monthly sales at $1.68M  

**Why this matters:**  
The company relies heavily on seasonal spikes—likely driven by holidays, Black Friday, and spring launches. This creates revenue gaps in off-peak months.

**Recommendation:**  
Close the gap in Q1 (Jan–Mar) through limited-time bundles, targeted loyalty discounts, and pre-launch incentives. A more even sales distribution could reduce overdependence on holiday periods.

### Insight 2: Three States Generate Over 63% of Total Revenue

**Top States by Revenue:**

| State       | Revenue        | Share of Total |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| California  | $11.24 million | 35.1%          |
| Texas       | $4.72 million  | 14.7%          |
| New York    | $4.25 million  | 13.3%          |

**Why this matters:**  
Revenue is concentrated in three states. This creates risk exposure if these key markets face saturation, competition, or economic shifts.

**Recommendation:**  
Maintain strong marketing in top-performing states, but identify high-growth potential in underpenetrated regions such as Florida, Illinois, or Georgia. Test regional campaigns to diversify and reduce geographic risk.

### Insight 3: Five Products Account for Two-Thirds of Revenue

**Top 5 Products by Revenue:**

| Product                | Units Sold | Revenue       |
|------------------------|------------|---------------|
| MacBook                | 4,724      | $7.79 million |
| iPhone                 | 6,845      | $4.24 million |
| ThinkPad               | 4,126      | $3.83 million |
| Google Phone           | 5,528      | $3.04 million |
| 34in UltraWide Monitor | 6,192      | $2.48 million |

Combined, these products contribute over 66.5% of total revenue.

**Why this matters:**  
This aligns with the Pareto principle: a small group of high-performing SKUs drives a large share of results. These products likely influence customer acquisition and brand preference.

**Recommendation:**  
Prioritize inventory, promotion, and customer reviews for top SKUs. Bundle them with complementary products or services to increase cart size. Explore phasing out low-contribution SKUs to streamline operations.

### Insight 4: Gold and Silver Customers Drive 71% of Revenue

**Revenue by Classification:**

| Classification | Revenue        | % of Total | Avg Spend per Customer |
|----------------|----------------|------------|-------------------------|
| Gold           | $11.5 million  | 35.9%      | $327.78                |
| Silver         | $11.36 million | 35.4%      | $288.52                |
| Bronze         | $7.80 million  | 24.3%      | $160.10                |
| Platinum       | $1.36 million  | 4.3%       | $490.18                |

**Why this matters:**  
While Platinum customers spend more individually, the bulk of the revenue comes from Gold and Silver segments—likely repeat buyers with consistent purchasing behavior.

**Recommendation:**  
Focus on retention strategies for Gold and Silver customers: exclusive access, loyalty perks, personalized offers. These segments are scalable and responsive to ongoing engagement.

### Insight 5: A Small Group of Customers Are High-Value Outliers

The top 10 customers generate over **$X** in revenue, contributing approximately **Y%** of the total. Each spends between **$A** and **$B** annually, often purchasing premium items in higher volumes.

**Why this matters:**  
These customers behave more like B2B or power buyers. Understanding their patterns can unlock insights into profitable niches or opportunities for upselling.

**Recommendation:**  
Use customer profiling to create a premium tier—offering concierge support, early access to products, or account-based marketing. This can increase repeat purchases and referrals while solidifying brand loyalty.
