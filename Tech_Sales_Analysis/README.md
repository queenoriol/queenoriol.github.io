# Tech & Gadget Sales Analysis (2019)

This project presents an in-depth sales analysis of a tech and gadget retail company using a dataset of over 185,000 orders across 8 U.S. states. The analysis was performed using Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for modeling and visualization.

The goal is to uncover trends in customer behavior, product performance, geographic sales, and revenue concentration, and to provide actionable recommendations for improving business performance and strategic planning.

## Dataset Summary

| Metric                         | Value                  |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| Total Revenue                 | $32.03 million         |
| Products Sold                 | 208,771 units          |
| Total Orders                  | 185,652                |
| Unique Customers              | 140,787                |
| Average Order Value           | $172.50                |
| States Covered                | 8                      |
| Customer Segments             | Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze |

Data cleaning involved fixing missing entries, removing duplicates, standardizing customer classification labels, and checking for anomalies. The cleaned data was imported into Power BI, where key performance indicators and visualizations were built using DAX and slicers for interactive exploration.

## Insight #1: Sales are Highest in Q4 and Q2

**What was observed:**  
- Revenue peaked in December ($4.29M) and October ($3.48M)  
- Q4 (Octâ€“Dec) and Q2 (Aprâ€“Jun) combined contribute approximately 47% of total annual revenue  
- Sales dip significantly in January, recording the lowest revenue at $1.68M

**Why this matters:**  
The strong Q4 performance likely reflects the seasonality of consumer behavior, benefiting from holiday promotions like Black Friday and Christmas. Q2's strength may be attributed to spring sales and product launches.

**Strategic recommendation:**  
Introduce seasonal campaigns during slower months (Janâ€“Mar) using discount bundles, back-to-school offers, or loyalty incentives. This can help level out revenue across the year and reduce reliance on seasonal spikes.

## Insight #2: Revenue is Highly Concentrated in Three States

**Top Performing States by Revenue:**

| State        | Revenue         | Share of Total |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| California   | $11.24 million  | 35.1%          |
| Texas        | $4.72 million   | 14.7%          |
| New York     | $4.25 million   | 13.3%          |

These three states contribute over 63.1% of the total revenue.

**Why this matters:**  
The company's revenue is geographically concentrated, indicating high dependence on a few key markets. This could be risky if sales in these states slow down due to competition, economic factors, or regulation.

**Strategic recommendation:**  
While continuing to support high-performing states with regional marketing, it is important to identify underperforming but populous states (e.g., Florida, Georgia, or Illinois) with growth potential. Localized promotions and distribution expansion could diversify revenue sources.

## Insight #3: A Small Set of Products Drives Nearly Half of All Revenue

**Top 5 Products by Revenue:**

| Product                | Units Sold | Revenue         |
|------------------------|------------|-----------------|
| MacBook                | 4,724      | $7.79 million   |
| iPhone                 | 6,845      | $4.24 million   |
| ThinkPad               | 4,126      | $3.83 million   |
| Google Phone           | 5,528      | $3.04 million   |
| 34in UltraWide Monitor | 6,192      | $2.48 million   |

These products account for over 66.5% of total revenue.

**Why this matters:**  
The sales pattern follows the Pareto principle (80/20 rule), where a small set of high-value, high-demand products contributes a large portion of revenue. These products are also likely to drive brand perception and customer acquisition.

**Strategic recommendation:**  
Ensure consistent stock levels of top-performing products and prioritize them in advertising campaigns. Consider bundling with accessories or offering extended warranties to increase average order value. This also suggests an opportunity to investigate underperforming SKUs for potential discontinuation.

## Insight #4: Gold and Silver Customers Drive Majority of Revenue

**Revenue by Customer Classification:**

| Classification | Revenue         | % of Total | Avg Spend per Customer |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------------|
| Gold           | $11.5 million   | 35.9%      | $327.78               |
| Silver         | $11.36 million  | 35.4%      | $288.52               |
| Bronze         | $7.80 million   | 24.3%      | $160.10               |
| Platinum       | $1.36 million   | 4.3%       | $490.18               |

Although Platinum customers spend more per transaction, they represent a very small segment. Gold and Silver customers make up over 71% of revenue and have a strong balance of frequency and value.

**Why this matters:**  
These classifications likely reflect spending habits or loyalty tiers. Understanding the behavior of mid-tier customers who purchase consistently is more scalable for growth than focusing solely on the high-spend, low-volume Platinum group.

**Strategic recommendation:**  
Design customer retention strategies focused on Gold and Silver segmentsâ€”such as exclusive promotions, reward points, and early product access. Personalization for these groups can improve customer lifetime value without increasing acquisition costs.

## Insight #5: A Few Customers Are High-Value Outliers

The top 10 customers collectively generate over $X, representing around Y% of the total revenue. Each spends around $A to $B annually.

**Why this matters:**  
While these customers form a small percentage of the base, their impact is significant. They often purchase premium products and may be early adopters or influencers.

**Strategic recommendation:**  
Implement customer profiling to track high-value buyer behavior and offer personalized experiences (e.g., early product releases, account managers). Nurturing these relationships can lead to repeat purchases, referrals, and brand advocacy.
