## Tourism Overview

Following the lifting of travel restrictions and the return of traveler confidence, Finland has seen a steady recovery in international visitor arrivals.

While the number of visitors may not have drastically increased, the total tourism revenue rose to **€2.21 billion** in 2024—an increase of **4.06%** from the previous year. This suggests that travelers arriving from abroad are spending more per visit, indicating a shift toward longer, more meaningful trips and a continued interest in Finland's nature, safety, and cultural authenticity.

Seasonality remains significant, with summer being the busiest period. A deeper look into specific demographics—particularly travelers aged **25–44** and **45–64**—revealed that this group contributes the majority of tourism revenue. These two age groups were prioritized in the analysis as they represent the core of the working population and are likely to have more stable income and travel patterns.

Notably, business-related travel has also stabilized, with an increasing average length of stay among working professionals, pointing to opportunities for targeted, value-driven tourism offerings.
